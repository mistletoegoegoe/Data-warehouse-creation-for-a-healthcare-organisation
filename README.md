## I. Star schema design
### 1. Case study
North and West Yorkshire CCG is seeking a health and social care system that integrates data from care homes and social care services. Leeds City Council operates six care homes providing extended support for elderly patients. 
The system aims to assess care home effectiveness, review recovery periods and bed occupancy, and facilitate collaboration between doctors and social care services. 
Due to the case study, some requirements and characteristics of integrated data system can be deduced as below: 
-	Centralised data system works with data from many sources 
-	The dataset of care homes and social services care grows minutes by minutes due to the increasing in the number and information of patients, thus, this dataset is very huge
-	The durability of data system is important, as this is a long-term project which will last many years and update continuously. 
### 2. Identify stakeholders, main objective and reports
From the objective of the data system that needs to be built, many objectives and related stakeholders can be chosen to deliver information and insights. However, this project focuses on:  
-	Objective: Bed occupancy assessment
-	Stakeholder: Care home managers
